// Entries marked [ASSUMED] are NOT confirmed by the shop owner. Each names the
// open question that closes it. They render on all 16 pages, and the hours also

	// category pages) as well as the structured-data telephone property. Change

	// artifact supplies their international forms, and inventing them would
	// publish two possibly-undialable numbers on sixteen pages while looking

	// This was +35929549710 — the main line — as an [ASSUMED] placeholder
	// against OWNER-QUESTIONS #21. It was a dead end: 02 954 9710 is a Sofia
	// LANDLINE and Viber accounts are provisioned against mobile numbers, so on
	// Android the button returned Viber's "the requested page is unavailable,
	// please update to the latest version" on all 16 deployed pages. The client
	// was current; the deep link simply did not resolve.
	//
	// That failure had TWO candidate causes which could not be told apart while
	// both were in play:
	//   (a) the number has no Viber account
	//   (b) viber://chat is the wrong deep-link path
	// They were separated by deploying a number known to HAVE Viber: the button
	// opened a conversation, so (b) is ELIMINATED — the viber://chat?number=
	// scheme is correct and the fix is a value change, not a rewrite.

	// the shop's two mobiles and was chosen 2026-08-09 as the likeliest, NOT
	// confirmed by the owner. A mobile is far more plausible than a landline,
	// but "more plausible" is exactly the reasoning that shipped the landline.
	// Verified only to the extent that pressing the deployed button opens a
	// Viber conversation — see 02-UAT.md test 28. If the owner names a different
