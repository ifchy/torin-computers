# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-04)

**Core value:** A visitor with a specific repair problem must immediately see that Torin fixes exactly that, and find a clear path to contact the shop.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Migration Safety Net & Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Migration Safety Net & Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-08-04 — Roadmap created (4 phases, 23/23 v1 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Research]: PHP-include restructuring chosen over Astro/Node rebuild — solves the real maintainability defect (duplicated header/nav/footer) with zero new tooling and the lowest risk to existing URL/SEO continuity.
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 isolates all migration-safety work (URL inventory, backup/rollback discipline, PHP-include foundation) before any visual rebuild starts, per research's top pitfall (broken URLs/lost rankings).
- [Roadmap]: Cutover folded into Phase 4 alongside hardening rather than its own phase — coarse granularity setting, and cutover has only one directly-owned requirement (MIGR-02); it is sequenced last regardless.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: `.htaccess` `AddType`-for-`.html`-as-PHP behavior is unconfirmed for `bell.host.bg` specifically — must be spike-verified early in Phase 1 before the whole site depends on it.
- [Phase 1]: PHP version and Composer availability on `bell.host.bg` unknown — needed to confirm PHPMailer install path (Phase 4 dependency).
- [Phase 3]: Category 6 (non-standard electrical equipment) has no existing content — needs direct owner input on scope before this content can be written.
- [Phase 3]: Google Business Profile status (active with reviews?) unverified — confirm before committing to the Google rating badge.
- [Phase 3/4]: Real price ranges, before/after photos, and turnaround-time commitments are v2 (deferred) but were owner-input-dependent gaps noted in research; not blocking v1.
- [Phase 4]: Holiday-banner script (`otpuska.js`) intent needs an explicit owner decision (keep with maintained equivalent, or drop).

## Deferred Items
