# Project State

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Research]: PHP-include restructuring chosen over Astro/Node rebuild — solves the real maintainability defect (duplicated header/nav/footer) with zero new tooling and the lowest risk to existing URL/SEO continuity.
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 isolates all migration-safety work (URL inventory, backup/rollback discipline, PHP-include foundation) before any visual rebuild starts, per research's top pitfall (broken URLs/lost rankings).
- [Roadmap]: Cutover folded into Phase 4 alongside hardening rather than its own phase — coarse granularity setting, and cutover has only one directly-owned requirement (MIGR-02); it is sequenced last regardless.
- [Phase ?]: MIGR-01 URL inventory: test-laptop.html resolved keep-as-is per DIFF-01; covid.html and problem-stari.html left decision-pending (owner sign-off required, not silently retired)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: `.htaccess` `AddType`-for-`.html`-as-PHP behavior is unconfirmed for `bell.host.bg` specifically — must be spike-verified early in Phase 1 before the whole site depends on it.
- [Phase 1]: PHP version and Composer availability on `bell.host.bg` unknown — needed to confirm PHPMailer install path (Phase 4 dependency).
- [Phase 3]: Category 6 (non-standard electrical equipment) has no existing content — needs direct owner input on scope before this content can be written.
- [Phase 3]: Google Business Profile status (active with reviews?) unverified — confirm before committing to the Google rating badge.
- [Phase 3/4]: Real price ranges, before/after photos, and turnaround-time commitments are v2 (deferred) but were owner-input-dependent gaps noted in research; not blocking v1.
- [Phase 4]: Holiday-banner script (`otpuska.js`) intent needs an explicit owner decision (keep with maintained equivalent, or drop).
- [Phase 1/3]: `covid.html`'s fate is undecided — pending-owner-decision, not silently retired. Content is slated to move to the About page per CONTENT-02 (Phase 3), but retiring the currently-indexed URL itself needs explicit owner sign-off before doing so, since an unreviewed retirement risks losing existing ranking/traffic. See `01-URL-INVENTORY.md`.
- [Phase 1]: `problem-stari.html`'s fate is undecided — pending-owner-decision. No current v1 requirement addresses this page; suspected content overlap with `mehanichni-problemi.html` is unconfirmed. Flag for owner review before any retire/merge/redirect decision is made. See `01-URL-INVENTORY.md`.

## Deferred Items
